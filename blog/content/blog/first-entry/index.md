description: "My first blog posting. Kicking the tires with gatsby and github pages"
---

This is my first post on my new gatsby + github pages based blog. I have follow instructions from this [blog ](https://nosleepjavascript.com/gatsby-blog/)to help in setting up this blog. It allows me to use the power of github and simplicity of markdown to create blog postings.

Some of the topics will include some of my hobbies: 3d printing, machine learning, blockchain and web tech!

Oh, and here's a great quote from softwarequotes.com from
[Bill Gates](https://www.softwarequotes.com/printableshowquotes.aspx?id=579).

> Software is a great combination between artistry and engineering. 
> When you finally get done and get to appreciate what you have done

> I think a lot of the people here feel that way. 

This blogging platform is also very nice for providing lots of code examples... I can use markdown to produce nice looking webpages with javascript or python

Python example
==============

```python
def doIt():
    print("this will do something)

doIt()
```

Javascript example
==================

```js
function doIt(){
    console.log('do it')
}
```

I can also use tables like this one:

| Number | Title                                    | Year |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | ---: |
| 1      | Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone | 2001 |
| 2      | Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  | 2002 |
| 3      | Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban | 2004 |
